# ebayScraper

This webCrawler will use BeautifulSoup to collect product data from Ebay.
Projects starts with an input asking the user what products are you searching for.
Once desire item is entered, Beautiful Soup will crawl Ebay and give you the results
After BeautifulSoup finishes crawling the item on ebay (I searched for iphones) results will be stored into a CSV file.
